This one was hard. It was digging deep into C++ stuff.

## Q1: Stay Positive
[LeetCode 1413](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-value-to-get-positive-step-by-step-sum/). Minimum Value to Get Positive Step by Step Sum.

Constraints were slightly different though:
-  `1 <= n <= 10^5`
-  `-10^6 <= arr[i] <= 10^6`

**Interview Answer**:

```py
import math

def minStart(arr):
    arrSum = []
    arrSum.append(arr[0])

    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        arrSum.append(arrSum[i-1] + arr[i])

    minSum = 1000000
    for i in range(len(arrSum)):
        if arrSum[i] < minSum:
            minSum = arrSum[i]

    if minSum == 1:
        return 0
    else:
        return 1 - minSum
    
arr1 = [-4, 3, 2, 1] # x = 5
result1 = minStart(arr1)
print(f'arr1 min start value: {result1}')

arr2 = [3, -6, 5, -2, 1] # x = 4
result2 = minStart(arr2)
print(f'arr2 min start value: {result2}')

arr3 = [5] # x = 1
result3 = minStart(arr3)
print(f'arr2 min start value: {result3}')
```

**Reflection Answer**:

The above passed all testcases but actually there was a part in the question that I totally got wrong:

> Return the minimum positive value of startValue such that the step by step sum is never less than 1.

The proper return would be:

```py
if (1 - minSum) > 1:
    return 1 - minSum
else:
    return 1
```
LeetCode answers actually gave a way shorter answer:

```py
def minStartValue(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
    total = 0
    minSum = 0
    
    for num in arr:
        total += num
        minSum = min(minSum, total)
        
    return 1 - minSum
```

And of course we should try this in C++:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minStartValue(vector<int>& nums) {
        int total = 0;
        int minSum = 0;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i){
            total += nums[i];
            minSum = std::min(minSum, total);
        }
        
        return 1 - minSum;
    }
};
```

> Pick **ONE** option:

> 2. `free(p);`
> 3. `delete p;`
> 4. `delete[] p;`

**Interview Answer:**

I chose option 4. Which is [the correct one](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/new/operator%20new[]/). `new` must match up with `delete`, and `new[]` must match up with `delete[]`.

**Reflection Answer:**

[More studying](geeksforgeeks.org/new-vs-malloc-and-free-vs-delete-in-c/) on `free()` vs `delete`:

- `free()` is a C library function that can also be used in C++, while `delete` is a C++ keyword.
- `free()` frees memory but doesnâ€™t call Destructor of a class whereas `delete` frees the memory and also calls the Destructor of the class.

## Q3: Which is the right answer to the following?
> ```cpp
> main() {
>     struct {
>         int i;
>     }xyz;
> 
>     (*xyz)-&gt;i=10;
>     printf("%d", xyz.i);
> }
> ```
> 
> What is the output of this program? Pick **ONE** option.
> 
> 1. Compile error
> 2. 10
> 3. Garbage value
> 4. Address of i

**Interview answer:**

I chose option 1, "compile error" because `gt` appeared out of nowhere, having not been even defined let alone declared.

**Reflection answer:**

Ok, after putting this through [godbolt.org](https://godbolt.org/) with the `x86-64 gcc (trunk)` compiler, I get the following errors:

```sh
<source>:1:1: warning: ISO C++ forbids declaration of 'main' with no type [-Wreturn-type]
    1 | main() {
      | ^~~~
<source>: In function 'int main()':
<source>:6:6: error: no match for 'operator*' (operand type is 'main()::<unnamed struct>')
    6 |     (*xyz)-&gt;i=10;
      |      ^~~~
<source>:6:13: error: 'gt' was not declared in this scope
    6 |     (*xyz)-&gt;i=10;
      |             ^~
<source>:6:16: error: 'i' was not declared in this scope
    6 |     (*xyz)-&gt;i=10;
      |                ^
<source>:7:5: error: 'printf' was not declared in this scope
    7 |     printf("%d", xyz.i);
      |     ^~~~~~
<source>:1:1: note: 'printf' is defined in header '<cstdio>'; did you forget to '#include <cstdio>'?
  +++ |+#include <cstdio>
    1 | main() {
Compiler returned: 1
```

Let's break it down, pretty simple:
1. `main()` must have a return type (should have been `int main()`)
2. `xyz` is a struct, not a pointer that allows dereferencing
3. `gt` doesn't exist (where was it declared?)
4. `i` doesn't exist (people can get confused but this is not referring to `xyz.i`)
5. need to include `<cstdio>` to use `printf`

## Q4: What is the output of the following code?

> ```cpp
> #include 
> void main()
> {
> char letter = 'Z';
> printf("\n%c", letter);
> }
> ```
> 
> Pick **ONE** option
> 1. Z
> 2. 90
> 3. Error
> 4. Garbage value

**Interview Answer:**
I chose Z, which is totally wrong in light of Q3.

**Reflection Answer:**

1. `#include` must include something
2. `main()` must return `int`
3. `printf()` need header `<cstdio>`

## Q5: Which one of the following statements allocates enough space?

> Which one of the following statements allocates enough space to hold an array of 10 integers that > are initialized to 0?
> 
> Pick **ONE** option.
> 
> 1. ```cpp
>     int *ptr = (int *) malloc(10*sizeof(int));
>     ```
> 2. ```cpp
>     int *ptr = (int *) malloc(10, sizeof(int));
>     ```
> 3. ```cpp
>     int *ptr = (int *) calloc(10, sizeof(int));
>     ```
> 4. ```cpp
>     int *ptr = (int *) alloc(10*sizeof(int));
>     ```

**Interview Answer:**

Chose option 3. `malloc` allocates unitialized memory. There is no `alloc`.

**Reflection Answer:**

Ok, _"the *alloc variants are pretty mnemonic" - Cascabel, StackOverflow_

[Difference between malloc and calloc?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1538420/difference-between-malloc-and-calloc)

- malloc = memory-alloc
- calloc = clear-alloc
- realloc = re-alloc

> `calloc()` gives you a zero-initialized buffer, while `malloc()` leaves the memory uninitialized.

## Q7: Product Defects

Frikin Dynamic Programming.

## Q8: Which is the right answer to the following?

> Different compilers and host OS behaviors affect how a C program can execute. The following program was compiled with GCC and executed in a Linux host. What happens when the following program is executed?
> 
> ```cpp
> int main(void)
> {
>     char *s = "hello world";
>     *s = 'H';
> }
> ```
> 
> Pick **ONE** option:
> 
> 1. SIGABRT signal is sent
> 2. SIGSEGV signal is sent
> 3. Program runs successfully, nothing is printed
> 4. SIGILL signal is sent

**Interview Answer:**

I chose option 3. Which is gonna be the WRONG answer I think.

**Reflection Answer:**

Segmentation fault, which is SIGSEGV.

Code works on [https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler) when run, but debug shows sigsegv.

Testing on https://godbolt.org/ shows that it would be SIGSEGV.
